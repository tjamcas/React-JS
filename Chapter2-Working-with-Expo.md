### Video 2: Creating a Snack
- Log in to Expo at <https://snack.expo.dev>
- Here is a simple React-Native app that was created as a snack project on Expo:
  ```
  import React from 'react';
  import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

  export default function App() {
    return(
      <View style = {{ padding: 50 }}>
        <Text>Hello World!</Text>
        <Text>Red</Text>
        <Text>Red</Text>
        <Text>Red</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
  ```
